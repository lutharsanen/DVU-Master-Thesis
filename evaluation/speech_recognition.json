    "32": "on sunday mornings as he passed the church door he glanced coldly at the worshippers who stood bareheaded four deep outside the church morally present at the mass which they could neither see nor hear their dull piety and the sickly smell of the cheap hair oil with which they had anointed their heads repelled him from the altar they prayed at",

    "99": "yes his mother was hostile to the idea as he had read from her listless silence",
    "100": "yet her mistrust pricked him more keenly than his fathers pride and he thought coldly how he had watched the faith which was fading down in his soul ageing and strengthening in her eyes",
    "101": "a dim antagonism gathered force within him and darkened his mind as a cloud against her disloyalty and when it passed cloud like leaving his mind serene and dutiful towards her again he was made aware dimly and without regret of a first noiseless sundering of their lives",
    "102": "the university",
    "103": "the end he had been born to serve yet did not see had led him to escape by an unseen path and now it beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was about to be opened to him",
    "104": "it was an elfin prelude endless and formless and as it grew wilder and faster the flames leaping out of time he seemed to hear from under the boughs and grasses wild creatures racing their feet pattering like rain upon the leaves",

    "106": "whose feet are as the feet of harts and underneath the everlasting arms",

    "110": "a squad of christian brothers was on its way back from the bull and had begun to pass two by two across the bridge soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding",
    "111": "angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their top heavy silk hats and humble tape like collars and loosely hanging clerical clothes",
    "112": "their piety would be like their names like their faces like their clothes and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble and contrite hearts it might be paid a far richer tribute of devotion than his had ever been a gift tenfold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration",
    "113": "it was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates stripped of his pride beaten and in beggars weeds that they would be generous towards him loving him as themselves",
    "114": "idle and embittering finally to argue against his own dispassionate certitude that the commandment of love bade us not to love our neighbour as ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves with the same kind of love",

    "118": "he allowed them to glow and fade hue after hue sunrise gold the russet and green of apple orchards azure of waves the grey fringed fleece of clouds",
    "119": "no it was not their colours it was the poise and balance of the period itself",
    "120": "he passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again",
    "121": "at that instant as it seemed to him the air was chilled and looking askance towards the water he saw a flying squall darkening and crisping suddenly the tide",
    "122": "a faint click at his heart a faint throb in his throat told him once more of how his flesh dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea yet he did not strike across the downs on his left but held straight on along the spine of rocks that pointed against the rivers mouth",
    "123": "a veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where the river was embayed",
    "124": "in the distance along the course of the slow flowing liffey slender masts flecked the sky and more distant still the dim fabric of the city lay prone in haze",
    "125": "like a scene on some vague arras old as mans weariness the image of the seventh city of christendom was visible to him across the timeless air no older nor more weary nor less patient of subjection than in the days of the thingmote",

    "133": "guzzle him now towser",
    "134": "help",
    "135": "help",
    "136": "he recognized their speech collectively before he distinguished their faces",
    "137": "the mere sight of that medley of wet nakedness chilled him to the bone",
    "138": "their bodies corpse white or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the sun gleamed with the wet of the sea their diving stone poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges and the rough hewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they scrambled in their horseplay gleamed with cold wet lustre",
    "139": "the towels with which they smacked their bodies were heavy with cold seawater and drenched with cold brine was their matted hair",
    "140": "he stood still in deference to their calls and parried their banter with easy words",
    "141": "how characterless they looked shuley without his deep unbuttoned collar ennis without his scarlet belt with the snaky clasp and connolly without his norfolk coat with the flapless side pockets it was a pain to see them and a sword like pain to see the signs of adolescence that made repellent their pitiable nakedness",
    "142": "perhaps they had taken refuge in number and noise from the secret dread in their souls",
    "143": "but he apart from them and in silence remembered in what dread he stood of the mystery of his own body",
    "144": "stephanos dedalos",
    "145": "bous stephaneforos",
    "146": "their banter was not new to him and now it flattered his mild proud sovereignty",
    "147": "now as never before his strange name seemed to him a prophecy",
    "148": "so timeless seemed the grey warm air so fluid and impersonal his own mood that all ages were as one to him",
    "149": "a moment before the ghost of the ancient kingdom of the danes had looked forth through the vesture of the hazewrapped city",
    "150": "now at the name of the fabulous artificer he seemed to hear the noise of dim waves and to see a winged form flying above the waves and slowly climbing the air",
    "151": "what did it mean",
    "152": "was it a quaint device opening a page of some medieval book of prophecies and symbols a hawk like man flying sunward above the sea a prophecy of the end he had been born to serve and had been following through the mists of childhood and boyhood a symbol of the artist forging anew in his workshop out of the sluggish matter of the earth a new soaring impalpable imperishable being",
    "153": "his heart trembled in an ecstasy of fear and his soul was in flight",
    "154": "an ecstasy of flight made radiant his eyes and wild his breath and tremulous and wild and radiant his windswept limbs",
    "155": "one",
    "156": "look out",
    "157": "one",
    "158": "one",
    "159": "his throat ached with a desire to cry aloud the cry of a hawk or eagle on high to cry piercingly of his deliverance to the winds",
    "160": "this was the call of life to his soul not the dull gross voice of the world of duties and despair not the inhuman voice that had called him to the pale service of the altar",
    "161": "an instant of wild flight had delivered him and the cry of triumph which his lips withheld cleft his brain",
    "162": "what were they now but cerements shaken from the body of deaththe fear he had walked in night and day the incertitude that had ringed him round the shame that had abased him within and withoutcerements the linens of the grave",
    "163": "his soul had arisen from the grave of boyhood spurning her grave clothes",
    "164": "he would create proudly out of the freedom and power of his soul as the great artificer whose name he bore a living thing new and soaring and beautiful impalpable imperishable",
    "165": "he started up nervously from the stone block for he could no longer quench the flame in his blood",
    "166": "he felt his cheeks aflame and his throat throbbing with song",
    "167": "he looked northward towards howth",
    "168": "emerald and black and russet and olive it moved beneath the current swaying and turning",
    "169": "the water of the rivulet was dark with endless drift and mirrored the high drifting clouds",
    "170": "the clouds were drifting above him silently and silently the seatangle was drifting below him and the grey warm air was still and a new wild life was singing in his veins",
    "171": "where was his boyhood now",
    "172": "he was unheeded happy and near to the wild heart of life",
    "173": "her thighs fuller and soft hued as ivory were bared almost to the hips where the white fringes of her drawers were like feathering of soft white down",
    "174": "her slate blue skirts were kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her",
    "175": "her bosom was as a birds soft and slight slight and soft as the breast of some dark plumaged dove",
    "176": "but her long fair hair was girlish and girlish and touched with the wonder of mortal beauty her face",
    "177": "she was alone and still gazing out to sea and when she felt his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him in quiet sufferance of his gaze without shame or wantonness",
    "178": "heavenly god cried stephens soul in an outburst of profane joy",
    "179": "he turned away from her suddenly and set off across the strand",
    "180": "her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call",
    "181": "to live to err to fall to triumph to recreate life out of life",
    "182": "a wild angel had appeared to him the angel of mortal youth and beauty an envoy from the fair courts of life to throw open before him in an instant of ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory",
    "183": "what hour was it",
    "184": "he felt above him the vast indifferent dome and the calm processes of the heavenly bodies and the earth beneath him the earth that had borne him had taken him to her breast",
    "185": "his eyelids trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth and her watchers trembled as if they felt the strange light of some new world",
    "186": "his soul was swooning into some new world fantastic dim uncertain as under sea traversed by cloudy shapes and beings",
    "187": "a world a glimmer or a flower",
    "188": "evening had fallen when he woke and the sand and arid grasses of his bed glowed no longer",
    "189": "he climbed to the crest of the sandhill and gazed about him",
    "190": "three",
    "191": "you see how doubly how intimately opposed the ideas are yet how difficult to explain without apparent contradiction",
    "192": "so that the schools of crystal visionary passionate and fantastic in purpose are in method trenchantly formal and clear and the schools of clay absolutely realistic temperate and simple in purpose are in method mysterious and soft sometimes licentious sometimes terrific and always obscure",
    "193": "by being studious of color they are studious of division and while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thingunseparated light the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light",
    "194": "and therefore primarily they must be able to divide so that elementary exercises in color must be directed like first exercises in music to the clear separation of notes and the final perfections of color are those in which of innumerable notes or hues every one has a distinct office and can be fastened on by the eye and approved as fulfilling it",
    "195": "my first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side",
    "196": "some of the touches indeed when the tint has been mixed with much water have been laid in little drops or ponds so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge",
    "197": "and one of the chief delights which any one who really enjoys painting finds in that art as distinct from sculpture is in this exquisite inlaying or joiners work of it the fitting of edge to edge with a manual skill precisely correspondent to the close application of crowded notes without the least slur in fine harp or piano playing",
    "198": "then he comes to the beak of it",
    "199": "the brown ground beneath is left for the most part one touch of black is put for the hollow two delicate lines of dark gray define the outer curve and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible",
    "200": "there are just four touchesfine as the finest penmanshipto do that beak and yet you will find that in the peculiar paroquettish mumbling and nibbling action of it and all the character in which this nibbling beak differs from the tearing beak of the eagle it is impossible to go farther or be more precise",
    "201": "of course i cannot do so myself yet in these sketches of mine made for the sake of color there is enough to show you the nature and the value of the method they are two pieces of study of the color of marble architecture the tints literally edified and laid edge to edge as simply on the paper as the stones are on the walls",
    "202": "again there is not a touch of black in any shadow however deep of these two studies so that if i chose to put a piece of black near them it would be conspicuous with a vengeance",
    "203": "but in this vignette copied from turner you have the two principles brought out perfectly",
    "204": "you have the white of foaming water of buildings and clouds brought out brilliantly from a white ground and though part of the subject is in deep shadow the eye at once catches the one black point admitted in front",
    "205": "i say whether color be gay or sad",
    "206": "george of carpaccio at venice are all that i can name myself of great works",
    "207": "but there exist some exquisite though feebler designs in missal painting of which in england the landscape and flowers in the psalter of henry the sixth will serve you for a sufficient type the landscape in the grimani missal at venice being monumentally typical and perfect",
    "208": "now for your own practice in this having first acquired the skill of exquisite delineation and laying of pure color day by day you must draw some lovely natural form or flower or animal without obscurityas in missal painting choosing for study in natural scenes only what is beautiful and strong in life",
    "209": "i fully anticipated at the beginning of the pre raphaelite movement that they would have carried forward this method of work but they broke themselves to pieces by pursuing dramatic sensation instead of beauty",
    "210": "do not therefore think that the gothic school is an easy one",
    "211": "you might more easily fill a house with pictures like constables from garret to cellar than imitate one cluster of leaves by van eyck or giotto and among all the efforts that have been made to paint our common wild flowers i have only onceand that in this very year just in time to show it to youseen the thing done rightly",
    "212": "our uneducated men work too bluntly to be ever in the right but the germans draw finely and resolutely wrong",
    "213": "but this peacock being drawn with intense delight in blue on gold and getting character of peacock in the general sharp outline instead ofas rubens peacocksin black shadow is distinctively gothic of fine style",
    "214": "i wish you therefore to begin your study of natural history and landscape by discerning the simple outlines and the pleasant colors of things and to rest in them as long as you can",
    "215": "but observe you can only do this on one conditionthat of striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination",
    "216": "none of this bright gothic art was ever done but either by faith in the attainableness of felicity in heaven or under conditions of real order and delicate loveliness on the earth",
    "217": "but if you go on into the veracities of the school of clay you will find there is something at the roots of almond and apple trees which isthis",
    "218": "you must look at him in the facefight himconquer him with what scathe you may you need not think to keep out of the way of him",
    "219": "but look here at carpaccio even in my copy",
    "220": "and also carpaccio does it with a touch with one sweep of his brush three minutes at the most allowed for all the beast while michael angelo has been haggling at this dragons neck for an hour",
    "221": "nothing will be more precious to you i think in the practical study of art than the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour of the way all things are bound together little and great in spirit and in matter",
    "222": "so that if you get once the right clue to any group of them it will grasp the simplest yet reach to the highest truths",
    "223": "well then last here is turners greek school of the highest class and you define his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire",
    "224": "only there are two sorts of cloud and fire",
    "225": "he knows them both",
    "226": "now in this of burne jones the landscape is clearly full of light everywhere color or glass light that is the outline is prepared for modification of color only",
    "227": "every plant in the grass is set formally grows perfectly and may be realized completely",
    "228": "thus in chaucers dream",
    "229": "in both the vegetation though beautiful is absolutely wild and uncared for as it seems either by human or by higher powers which having appointed for it the laws of its being leave it to spring into such beauty as is consistent with disease and alternate with decay",
    "230": "in a few moments to lose her forever",

    "445": "the fellow is stricken with a judgment and is mad",
    "446": "the spirits of the scout and the astonishing success of the chase in which a circuitous distance of more than forty miles had been passed did not fail to impart a portion of hope to the whole party",
    "447": "but while the earth was trodden and the footsteps of both men and beasts were so plainly visible around the place the trail appeared to have suddenly ended",
    "448": "it was easy to follow the tracks of the narragansetts but they seemed only to have wandered without guides or any other object than the pursuit of food",

    "452": "a circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion",
    "453": "the impressions of footsteps were numerous but they all appeared like those of men who had wandered about the spot without any design to quit it",
    "454": "such cunning is not without its deviltry exclaimed hawkeye when he met the disappointed looks of his assistants",
    "455": "not a leaf was left unturned",
    "456": "the sticks were removed and the stones lifted for indian cunning was known frequently to adopt these objects as covers laboring with the utmost patience and industry to conceal each footstep as they proceeded",

    "458": "yet that is not the footstep of an indian the weight is too much on the heel and the toes are squared as though one of the french dancers had been in pigeon winging his tribe",

    "463": "the whole party now proceeded following the course of the rill keeping anxious eyes on the regular impressions",
    "464": "the water soon flowed into its bed again but watching the ground on either side the foresters pursued their way content with knowing that the trail lay beneath",
    "465": "it was fortunate they did so",
    "466": "pursuing the direction given by this discovery he entered the neighboring thicket and struck the trail as fresh and obvious as it had been before they reached the spring",
    "467": "shall we proceed demanded heyward",
    "468": "softly softly we know our path but it is good to examine the formation of things",
    "469": "this is my schooling major and if one neglects the book there is little chance of learning from the open land of providence",

    "473": "that providence is partial in its gifts for its own wise reasons the best and most contented of us must allow",
    "474": "of that there is little cause of fear returned the scout slowly shaking his head this is a firm and straight though a light step and not over long",
    "475": "see the heel has hardly touched the ground and there the dark hair has made a little jump from root to root",
    "476": "no no my knowledge for it neither of them was nigh fainting hereaway",
    "477": "from such undeniable testimony did the practised woodsman arrive at the truth with nearly as much certainty and precision as if he had been a witness of all those events which his ingenuity so easily elucidated cheered by these assurances and satisfied by a reasoning that was so obvious while it was so simple the party resumed its course after making a short halt to take a hurried repast",
    "478": "before an hour had elapsed however the speed of hawkeye sensibly abated and his head instead of maintaining its former direct and forward look began to turn suspiciously from side to side as if he were conscious of approaching danger",
    "479": "he soon stopped again and waited for the whole party to come up",
    "480": "i scent the hurons he said speaking to the mohicans yonder is open sky through the treetops and we are getting too nigh their encampment sagamore you will take the hillside to the right uncas will bend along the brook to the left while i will try the trail",
    "481": "if anything should happen the call will be three croaks of a crow",
    "482": "i saw one of the birds fanning himself in the air just beyond the dead oakanother sign that we are approaching an encampment",
    "483": "recovering his recollection on the instant instead of sounding an alarm which might prove fatal to himself he remained stationary an attentive observer of the others motions",
    "484": "an instant of calm observation served to assure duncan that he was undiscovered",
    "485": "it was impossible to discover the expression of his features through the grotesque mask of paint under which they were concealed though duncan fancied it was rather melancholy than savage his head was shaved as usual with the exception of the crown from whose tuft three or four faded feathers from a hawks wing were loosely dangling",
    "486": "a ragged calico mantle half encircled his body while his nether garment was composed of an ordinary shirt the sleeves of which were made to perform the office that is usually executed by a much more commodious arrangement",
    "487": "altogether the appearance of the individual was forlorn and miserable",
    "488": "you see we have reached their settlement or encampment whispered the young man and here is one of the savages himself in a very embarrassing position for our further movements",
    "489": "hawkeye started and dropped his rifle when directed by the finger of his companion the stranger came under his view",
    "490": "then lowering the dangerous muzzle he stretched forward his long neck as if to assist a scrutiny that was already intensely keen",
    "491": "can you see where he has put his rifle or his bow",
    "492": "he appears to have no arms nor does he seem to be viciously inclined unless he communicate the alarm to his fellows who as you see are dodging about the water we have but little to fear from him",
    "493": "the scout turned to heyward and regarded him a moment with unconcealed amazement",
    "494": "repeating the words fellows who are dodging about the water he added so much for schooling and passing a boyhood in the settlements the knave has long legs though and shall not be trusted",
    "495": "do you keep him under your rifle while i creep in behind through the bush and take him alive",
    "496": "fire on no account",
    "497": "if i see you in danger may i not risk a shot",
    "498": "fire a whole platoon major",
    "499": "in the next moment he was concealed by the leaves",
    "500": "then he reappeared creeping along the earth from which his dress was hardly distinguishable directly in the rear of his intended captive",
    "501": "having reached within a few yards of the latter he arose to his feet silently and slowly",
    "502": "instead of taking the alarm the unconscious savage stretched forward his neck as if he also watched the movements about the gloomy lake with a sort of silly curiosity",
    "503": "in the meantime the uplifted hand of hawkeye was above him",
    "504": "how now friend have you a mind to teach the beavers to sing",
    "505": "chapter twenty six",
    "506": "now let us to business",
    "507": "can you lead me to him",
    "508": "but it was not the policy of hawkeye to affect the least concealment",
    "509": "still they betrayed no intention to depart",
    "510": "but the bear instead of obeying maintained the seat it had taken and growled",
    "511": "then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his position and slowly entered the place it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purposed of cookery",
    "512": "the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy",
    "513": "hawkeye",
    "514": "cut his bands said hawkeye to david who just then approached them",
    "515": "whither",
    "516": "so uncas you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed",
    "517": "uncas will stay was the calm reply",
    "518": "for what",
    "519": "but i thought i would make the offer seeing that youth commonly loves life",
    "520": "if you stay it must be to sit down here in the shadow and take the part of uncas until such times as the cunning of the indians discover the cheat when as i have already said your times of trial will come",
    "521": "so choose for yourselfto make a rush or tarry here",
    "522": "hold your head down and draw in your legs their formation might tell the truth too early",
    "523": "the scout hesitated and appeared to muse",
    "524": "the little knot of indians drew back in a body and suffered as they thought the conjurer and his inspired assistant to proceed",
    "525": "hold said the scout grasping his friend by the shoulder let them yell again",
    "526": "twas nothing but wonderment",
    "527": "now let the devils strike our scent said the scout tearing two rifles with all their attendant accouterments from beneath a bush and flourishing killdeer as he handed uncas his weapon two at least will find it to their deaths",
    "528": "with due discretion the incident itself may however be described since it serves to illustrate some of those qualities for which my friend was remarkable i will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned",
    "529": "mr soames was a tall spare man of a nervous and excitable temperament",
    "530": "i trust mr holmes that you can spare me a few hours of your valuable time",
    "531": "i should much prefer that you called in the aid of the police",
    "532": "i beg you mr holmes to do what you can",
    "533": "my friends temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street",
    "534": "without his scrapbooks his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man",
    "535": "he shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence while our visitor in hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth his story",
    "536": "i must explain to you mr holmes that to morrow is the first day of the examination for the fortescue scholarship",
    "537": "i am one of the examiners",
    "538": "to day about three oclock the proofs of this paper arrived from the printers",
    "539": "the exercise consists of half a chapter of thucydides",
    "540": "i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct",
    "541": "i had however promised to take tea in a friends rooms so i left the proof upon my desk",
    "542": "i was absent rather more than an hour",
    "543": "as i approached my outer door i was amazed to see a key in it",
    "544": "for an instant i imagined that i had left my own there but on feeling in my pocket i found that it was all right",
    "545": "i found that the key was indeed his that he had entered my room to know if i wanted tea and that he had very carelessly left the key in the door when he came out",
    "546": "the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers",
    "547": "the proof was in three long slips",
    "548": "i had left them all together",
    "549": "holmes stirred for the first time",
    "550": "the first page on the floor the second in the window the third where you left it said he",
    "551": "exactly mr holmes",
    "552": "how could you possibly know that",
    "553": "pray continue your very interesting statement",
    "554": "for an instant i imagined that bannister had taken the unpardonable liberty of examining my papers",
    "555": "he denied it however with the utmost earnestness and i am convinced that he was speaking the truth",
    "556": "the alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers",
    "557": "a large sum of money is at stake for the scholarship is a very valuable one and an unscrupulous man might very well run a risk in order to gain an advantage over his fellows",
    "558": "bannister was very much upset by the incident",
    "559": "i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while i made a most careful examination of the room",
    "560": "i soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled papers",
    "561": "on the table in the window were several shreds from a pencil which had been sharpened",
    "562": "a broken tip of lead was lying there also",
    "563": "evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry had broken his pencil and had been compelled to put a fresh point to it",
    "564": "excellent said holmes who was recovering his good humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case",
    "565": "this was not all",
    "566": "i have a new writing table with a fine surface of red leather",
    "567": "i am prepared to swear and so is bannister that it was smooth and unstained",
    "568": "now i found a clean cut in it about three inches longnot a mere scratch but a positive cut",
    "569": "not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black dough or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it",
    "570": "i am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers",
    "571": "there were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity",
    "572": "i was at my wits end when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town and i came straight round to put the matter into your hands",
    "573": "do help me mr holmes",
    "574": "you see my dilemma",
    "575": "above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly",
    "576": "the case is not entirely devoid of interest",
    "577": "for which he was entered",
    "578": "yes",
    "579": "to the best of my belief they were rolled up",
    "580": "but might be recognized as proofs",
    "581": "possibly",
    "582": "no",
    "583": "did anyone know that these proofs would be there",
    "584": "no one save the printer",
    "585": "did this man bannister know",
    "586": "where is bannister now",
    "587": "i left him collapsed in the chair",
    "588": "i was in such a hurry to come to you",
    "589": "you left your door open",
    "590": "i locked up the papers first",
    "591": "then it amounts to this mr soames that unless the indian student recognized the roll as being proofs the man who tampered with them came upon them accidentally without knowing that they were there",
    "592": "so it seems to me",
    "593": "holmes gave an enigmatic smile",
    "594": "well said he let us go round",
    "595": "not one of your cases watsonmental not physical",
    "596": "all right come if you want to",
    "597": "now mr soamesat your disposal",
    "598": "a gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase",
    "599": "on the ground floor was the tutors room",
    "600": "above were three students one on each story",
    "601": "it was already twilight when we reached the scene of our problem",
    "602": "holmes halted and looked earnestly at the window",
    "603": "then he approached it and standing on tiptoe with his neck craned he looked into the room",
    "604": "he must have entered through the door",
    "605": "there is no opening except the one pane said our learned guide",
    "606": "well if there is nothing to be learned here we had best go inside",
    "607": "the lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his room",
    "608": "we stood at the entrance while holmes made an examination of the carpet",
    "609": "i am afraid there are no signs here said he",
    "610": "one could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day",
    "611": "your servant seems to have quite recovered you left him in a chair you say",
    "612": "which chair",
    "613": "by the window there",
    "614": "i see",
    "615": "i have finished with the carpet",
    "616": "let us take the little table first",
    "617": "of course what has happened is very clear",
    "618": "the man entered and took the papers sheet by sheet from the central table",
    "619": "he carried them over to the window table because from there he could see if you came across the courtyard and so could effect an escape",
    "620": "as a matter of fact he could not said soames for i entered by the side door",
    "621": "ah thats good",
    "622": "well anyhow that was in his mind",
    "623": "let me see the three strips",
    "624": "well he carried over this one first and he copied it",
    "625": "then he tossed it down and seized the next",
    "626": "he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreatvery hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there",
    "627": "well he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil and had as you observe to sharpen it again",
    "628": "this is of interest watson",
    "629": "the pencil was not an ordinary one",
    "630": "you see",
    "631": "there are others",
    "632": "what could this n n be",
    "633": "it is at the end of a word",
    "634": "you are aware that johann faber is the most common makers name",
    "635": "is it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as usually follows the johann he held the small table sideways to the electric light",
    "636": "i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface",
    "637": "no i see nothing",
    "638": "as you say there appear to be grains of sawdust in it",
    "639": "dear me this is very interesting",
    "640": "and the cuta positive tear i see",
    "641": "it began with a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole",
    "642": "where does that door lead to",
    "643": "to my bedroom",
    "644": "have you been in it since your adventure",
    "645": "i should like to have a glance round",
    "646": "what about this curtain",
    "647": "no one there i suppose",
    "648": "as a matter of fact the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of pegs",
    "649": "it was a small pyramid of black putty like stuff exactly like the one upon the table of the study",
    "650": "holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light",
    "651": "what could he have wanted there",
    "652": "i think it is clear enough",
    "653": "what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself",
    "654": "good gracious mr holmes do you mean to tell me that all the time i was talking to bannister in this room we had the man prisoner if we had only known it",
    "655": "surely there is another alternative mr holmes",
    "656": "i dont know whether you observed my bedroom window",
    "657": "lattice paned lead framework three separate windows one swinging on hinge and large enough to admit a man",
    "658": "exactly",
    "659": "and it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as to be partly invisible",
    "660": "the man might have effected his entrance there left traces as he passed through the bedroom and finally finding the door open have escaped that way",
    "661": "holmes shook his head impatiently",
    "662": "let us be practical said he",
    "663": "yes there are",
    "664": "yes",
    "665": "soames hesitated",
    "666": "it is a very delicate question said he",
    "667": "one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs",
    "668": "i will look after the proofs",
    "669": "i will tell you then in a few words the character of the three men who inhabit these rooms",
    "670": "the lower of the three is gilchrist a fine scholar and athlete plays in the rugby team and the cricket team for the college and got his blue for the hurdles and the long jump",
    "671": "his father was the notorious sir jabez gilchrist who ruined himself on the turf",
    "672": "my scholar has been left very poor but he is hardworking and industrious",
    "673": "he will do well",
    "674": "he is a quiet inscrutable fellow as most of those indians are",
    "675": "he is well up in his work though his greek is his weak subject",
    "676": "the top floor belongs to miles mclaren",
    "677": "he is a brilliant fellow when he chooses to workone of the brightest intellects of the university but he is wayward dissipated and unprincipled",
    "678": "he was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first year",
    "679": "he has been idling all this term and he must look forward with dread to the examination",
    "680": "i dare not go so far as that",
    "681": "but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely",
    "682": "exactly",
    "683": "his plump face was twitching with his nervousness and his fingers could not keep still",
    "684": "we are investigating this unhappy business bannister said his master",
    "685": "i understand said holmes that you left your key in the door",
    "686": "it was most unfortunate sir",
    "687": "when did you enter the room",
    "688": "it was about half past four",
    "689": "how long did you stay",
    "690": "when i saw that he was absent i withdrew at once",
    "691": "did you look at these papers on the table",
    "692": "no sircertainly not",
    "693": "how came you to leave the key in the door",
    "694": "i had the tea tray in my hand",
    "695": "i thought i would come back for the key then i forgot",
    "696": "anyone in the room could get out",
    "697": "yes sir",
    "698": "when mr soames returned and called for you you were very much disturbed",
    "699": "i nearly fainted sir",
    "700": "where were you when you began to feel bad",
    "701": "why did you pass these other chairs",
    "702": "i dont know sir it didnt matter to me where i sat",
    "703": "he was looking very badquite ghastly",
    "704": "whom do you suspect",
    "705": "thank you that will do said holmes",
    "706": "very good",
    "707": "now mr soames we will take a walk in the quadrangle if you please",
    "708": "whats that",
    "709": "one of them seems restless enough",
    "710": "it was the indian whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind",
    "711": "he was pacing swiftly up and down his room",
    "712": "i should like to have a peep at each of them said holmes",
    "713": "is it possible",
    "714": "no difficulty in the world soames answered",
    "715": "come along and i will personally conduct you",
    "716": "no names please said holmes as we knocked at gilchrists door",
    "717": "a tall flaxen haired slim young fellow opened it and made us welcome when he understood our errand",
    "718": "there were some really curious pieces of mediaeval domestic architecture within",
    "719": "holmes was so charmed with one of them that he insisted on drawing it in his notebook broke his pencil had to borrow one from our host and finally borrowed a knife to sharpen his own",
    "720": "i could not see that in either case holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching",
    "721": "the outer door would not open to our knock and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad language came from behind it",
    "722": "i dont care who you are",
    "723": "can you tell me his exact height he asked",
    "724": "really mr holmes i cannot undertake to say",
    "725": "he is taller than the indian not so tall as gilchrist",
    "726": "i suppose five foot six would be about it",
    "727": "that is very important said holmes",
    "728": "and now mr soames i wish you good night",
    "729": "our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay",
    "730": "good gracious mr holmes you are surely not going to leave me in this abrupt fashion you dont seem to realize the position",
    "731": "i must take some definite action to night",
    "732": "i cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with",
    "733": "the situation must be faced",
    "734": "i shall drop round early to morrow morning and chat the matter over",
    "735": "it is possible that i may be in a position then to indicate some course of action",
    "736": "meanwhile you change nothingnothing at all",
    "737": "very good mr holmes",
    "738": "you can be perfectly easy in your mind",
    "739": "i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings",
    "740": "good bye",
    "741": "when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows",
    "742": "the indian still paced his room",
    "743": "the others were invisible",
    "744": "which is yours",
    "745": "the foul mouthed fellow at the top",
    "746": "he is the one with the worst record",
    "747": "there is nothing in that",
    "748": "many men do it when they are trying to learn anything by heart",
    "749": "he looked at us in a queer way",
    "750": "pencils too and knivesall was satisfactory",
    "751": "but that fellow does puzzle me",
    "752": "who",
    "753": "why bannister the servant",
    "754": "whats his game in the matter",
    "755": "he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man",
    "756": "thats the puzzling part",
    "757": "why should a perfectly honest manwell well heres a large stationers",
    "758": "there were only four stationers of any consequences in the town and at each holmes produced his pencil chips and bid high for a duplicate",
    "759": "all were agreed that one could be ordered but that it was not a usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in stock",
    "760": "my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation",
    "761": "no good my dear watson",
    "762": "this the best and only final clue has run to nothing",
    "763": "but indeed i have little doubt that we can build up a sufficient case without it",
    "764": "what with your eternal tobacco watson and your irregularity at meals i expect that you will get notice to quit and that i shall share your downfallnot however before we have solved the problem of the nervous tutor the careless servant and the three enterprising students",
    "765": "holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day though he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner",
    "766": "can you do without breakfast",
    "767": "certainly",
    "768": "have you anything positive to tell him",
    "769": "i think so",
    "770": "yes my dear watson i have solved the mystery",
    "771": "but what fresh evidence could you have got",
    "772": "aha",
    "773": "it is not for nothing that i have turned myself out of bed at the untimely hour of six",
    "774": "look at that",
    "775": "on the palm were three little pyramids of black doughy clay",
    "776": "and one more this morning",
    "777": "well come along and put friend soames out of his pain",
    "778": "the unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agitation when we found him in his chambers",
    "779": "in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards holmes with two eager hands outstretched",
    "780": "shall the examination proceed",
    "781": "yes let it proceed by all means",
    "782": "but this rascal",
    "783": "he shall not compete",
    "784": "you know him",
    "785": "i think so",
    "786": "if this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial",
    "787": "you there if you please soames",
    "788": "watson you here",
    "789": "ill take the armchair in the middle",
    "790": "kindly ring the bell",
    "791": "bannister entered and shrank back in evident surprise and fear at our judicial appearance",
    "792": "you will kindly close the door said holmes",
    "793": "now bannister will you please tell us the truth about yesterdays incident",
    "794": "i have told you everything sir",
    "795": "nothing to add",
    "796": "nothing at all sir",
    "797": "well then i must make some suggestions to you",
    "798": "bannisters face was ghastly",
    "799": "no sir certainly not",
    "800": "i frankly admit that i am unable to prove it",
    "801": "bannister licked his dry lips",
    "802": "ah thats a pity bannister",
    "803": "up to now you may have spoken the truth but now i know that you have lied",
    "804": "the mans face set in sullen defiance",
    "805": "there was no man sir",
    "806": "come come bannister",
    "807": "in that case you can give us no further information",
    "808": "an instant later the tutor returned bringing with him the student",
    "809": "he was a fine figure of a man tall lithe and agile with a springy step and a pleasant open face",
    "810": "his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon bannister in the farther corner",
    "811": "just close the door said holmes",
    "812": "now mr gilchrist we are all quite alone here and no one need ever know one word of what passes between us",
    "813": "we can be perfectly frank with each other",
    "814": "the unfortunate young man staggered back and cast a look full of horror and reproach at bannister",
    "815": "no no mr gilchrist sir i never said a wordnever one word cried the servant",
    "816": "for a moment gilchrist with upraised hand tried to control his writhing features",
    "817": "the next he had thrown himself on his knees beside the table and burying his face in his hands he had burst into a storm of passionate sobbing",
    "818": "come come said holmes kindly it is human to err and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal",
    "819": "perhaps it would be easier for you if i were to tell mr soames what occurred and you can check me where i am wrong",
    "820": "shall i do so",
    "821": "from the moment mr soames that you said to me that no one not even bannister could have told that the papers were in your room the case began to take a definite shape in my mind",
    "822": "the printer one could of course dismiss",
    "823": "he could examine the papers in his own office",
    "824": "if the proofs were in a roll he could not possibly know what they were",
    "825": "on the other hand it seemed an unthinkable coincidence that a man should dare to enter the room and that by chance on that very day the papers were on the table",
    "826": "i dismissed that",
    "827": "the man who entered knew that the papers were there",
    "828": "how did he know",
    "829": "when i approached your room i examined the window",
    "830": "such an idea was absurd",
    "831": "i was measuring how tall a man would need to be in order to see as he passed what papers were on the central table",
    "832": "i am six feet high and i could do it with an effort no one less than that would have a chance",
    "833": "i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table",
    "834": "of the centre table i could make nothing until in your description of gilchrist you mentioned that he was a long distance jumper",
    "835": "as he passed your window he saw by means of his great height these proofs upon your table and conjectured what they were",
    "836": "no harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant",
    "837": "it was not a dangerous exploit for he could always pretend that he had simply looked in to ask a question",
    "838": "he put his shoes on the table",
    "839": "what was it you put on that chair near the window",
    "840": "gloves said the young man",
    "841": "holmes looked triumphantly at bannister",
    "842": "he put his gloves on the chair and he took the proofs sheet by sheet to copy them",
    "843": "he thought the tutor must return by the main gate and that he would see him",
    "844": "as we know he came back by the side gate",
    "845": "there was no possible escape",
    "846": "you observe that the scratch on that table is slight at one side but deepens in the direction of the bedroom door",
    "847": "have i told the truth mr gilchrist",
    "848": "the student had drawn himself erect",
    "849": "yes sir it is true said he",
    "850": "good heavens have you nothing to add cried soames",
    "851": "yes sir i have but the shock of this disgraceful exposure has bewildered me",
    "852": "it was before i knew that my sin had found me out",
    "853": "here it is sir",
    "854": "you will see that i have said i have determined not to go in for the examination",
    "855": "but why did you change your purpose",
    "856": "gilchrist pointed to bannister",
    "857": "there is the man who set me in the right path said he",
    "858": "come now bannister said holmes",
    "859": "it will be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out as to his escaping by that window it was incredible",
    "860": "time was sir when i was butler to old sir jabez gilchrist this young gentlemans father when he was ruined i came to the college as servant but i never forgot my old employer because he was down in the world",
    "861": "well sir when i came into this room yesterday when the alarm was given the very first thing i saw was mr gilchrists tan gloves a lying in that chair",
    "862": "i knew those gloves well and i understood their message",
    "863": "if mr soames saw them the game was up",
    "864": "i flopped down into that chair and nothing would budge me until mr soames he went for you",
    "865": "wasnt it natural sir that i should save him and wasnt it natural also that i should try to speak to him as his dead father would have done and make him understand that he could not profit by such a deed",
    "866": "no indeed said holmes heartily springing to his feet",
    "867": "come watson",
    "868": "as to you sir i trust that a bright future awaits you in rhodesia",
    "869": "miss mary taylor did not take a college course for the purpose of teaching negroes",
    "870": "not that she objected to negroes as human beingsquite the contrary",
    "871": "nevertheless when the end of the summer came and the only opening facing her was the teaching of children at miss smiths experiment in the alabama swamps it must be frankly confessed that miss taylor was disappointed",
    "872": "she had pictured herself earning this by teaching one or two of her specialties in some private school near new york or boston or even in a western college",
    "873": "the south she had not thought of seriously and yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate she was not averse to charleston or new orleans",
    "874": "but from the offer that came to teach negroescountry negroes and little ones at thatshe shrank and indeed probably would have refused it out of hand had it not been for her queer brother john",
    "875": "might learn something useful down there",
    "876": "but john theres no societyjust elementary work",
    "877": "been looking up tooms county",
    "878": "some others too big cotton county",
    "879": "you ought to know john if i teach negroes ill scarcely see much of people in my own class",
    "880": "nonsense",
    "881": "show off",
    "882": "give em your greekand study cotton",
    "883": "at any rate i say go",
    "884": "and so howsoever reluctantly she had gone",
    "885": "whats the mere color of a human souls skin she had cried to a wellesley audience and the audience had applauded with enthusiasm",
    "886": "but here in alabama brought closely and intimately in touch with these dark skinned children their color struck her at first with a sort of terrorit seemed ominous and forbidding",
    "887": "she groped for new ways to teach colored brains and marshal colored thoughts and the result was puzzling both to teacher and student",
    "888": "miss smith represented the older new england of her parentshonest inscrutable determined with a conscience which she worshipped and utterly unselfish",
    "889": "she appealed to miss taylors ruddier and daintier vision but dimly and distantly as some memory of the past",
    "890": "the other teachers were indistinct personalities always very busy and very tired and talking school room with their meals",
    "891": "miss taylor was soon starving for human companionship for the lighter touches of life and some of its warmth and laughter",
    "892": "she wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies and reforms",
    "893": "she felt out of the world shut in and mentally anaemic great as the negro problem might be as a world problem it looked sordid and small at close range",
    "894": "so for the hundredth time she was thinking today as she walked alone up the lane back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms",
    "895": "she paused",
    "896": "the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her stretching away to the northward she remembered that beyond this little world it stretched on and onhow far she did not knowbut on and on in a great trembling sea and the foam of its mighty waters would one time flood the ends of the earth",
    "897": "she glanced absently at the boys",
    "898": "then her new england conscience stepped in",
    "899": "cotton is a wonderful thing is it not boys she said rather primly the boys touched their hats and murmured something indistinctly",
    "900": "miss taylor did not know much about cotton but at least one more remark seemed called for",
    "901": "what is planted over there she asked although she really didnt care",
    "902": "goobers answered the smaller boy",
    "903": "goobers uncomprehendingly",
    "904": "peanuts bles specified",
    "905": "oh murmured miss taylor",
    "906": "i suppose though its too early for them",
    "907": "then came the explosion",
    "908": "and bleswas miss taylor deceivedor was he chuckling",
    "909": "she reddened drew herself up and then dropping her primness rippled with laughter",
    "910": "he looked at her with twinkling eyes",
    "911": "the word was often on miss taylors lips and she recognized it",
    "912": "of course it isnti dont know anything about farming",
    "913": "but what did i say so funny",
    "914": "bles was now laughing outright",
    "915": "i declare",
    "916": "is that so",
    "917": "his eyes lighted for cotton was to him a very real and beautiful thing and a lifelong companion yet not one whose friendship had been coarsened and killed by heavy toil",
    "918": "but its prettiest when the bolls come and swell and burst and the cotton covers the field like foam all misty",
    "919": "the poetry of the thing began to sing within her awakening her unpoetic imagination and she murmured",
    "920": "the golden fleeceits the silver fleece",
    "921": "he harkened",
    "922": "no maam he said eagerly then glancing up toward the cresswell fields he saw two white men watching them",
    "923": "he grasped his hoe and started briskly to work",
    "924": "she began to realize that in this pleasant little chat the fact of the boys color had quite escaped her and what especially puzzled her was that this had not happened before",
    "925": "she started thinking of cottonbut at once she pulled herself back to the other aspect",
    "926": "always before she had been veiled from these folk who had put the veil there",
    "927": "the longer she thought the more bewildered she grew",
    "928": "at last the cotton combine was to all appearances an assured fact and he was slated for the senate",
    "929": "the price he had paid was high he was to represent the interests of the new trust and sundry favorable measures were already drafted and reposing in the safe of the combines legal department",
    "930": "among others was one relating to child labor another that would effect certain changes in the tariff and a proposed law providing for a cotton bale of a shape and dimensions different from the customarythe last constituting a particularly clever artifice which under the guise of convenience in handling would necessitate the installation of entirely new gin and compress machinery to be supplied of course by the trust",
    "931": "after all why should he care",
    "932": "he had tried independence and philanthropy and failed",
    "933": "why should he not be as other men",
    "934": "they were gentlemen",
    "935": "why should he pose as better than his fellows",
    "936": "there was young cresswell",
    "937": "did his aristocratic air prevent his succumbing to the lure of millions and promising the influence of his father and the whole farmers league to the new project",
    "938": "the door opened softly",
    "939": "there was just the touch of early autumn chill in the air without that made both the fire and the table with its soft linen gold and silver plate and twinkling glasses a warming satisfying sight",
    "940": "she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence in others",
    "941": "mrs greys chef was high priced and efficient and her butler was the envy of many consequently she knew the dinner would be good",
    "942": "to her intense satisfaction it was far more than this",
    "943": "it was a most agreeable couple of hours all save perhaps mr smith unbent the englishman especially and the vanderpools were most gracious but if the general pleasure was owing to any one person particularly it was to mr harry cresswell",
    "944": "why i thought said mrs grey that you southerners rather disapprovedor at least",
    "945": "mr cresswell inclined his head courteously",
    "946": "they all glanced at miss cresswell who lay softly back in her chair like a white lily gleaming and bejewelled her pale face flushing under the scrutiny mrs grey was horrified",
    "947": "mr cresswell sipped his wine slowly",
    "948": "really now you do not mean to say that there is a danger ofof amalgamation do you he sang",
    "949": "mr cresswell explained",
    "950": "no of course there was no immediate danger but when people were suddenly thrust beyond their natural station filled with wild ideas and impossible ambitions it meant terrible danger to southern white women",
    "951": "i believe in the training of people to their highest capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him",
    "952": "but cresswell added significantly capacity differs enormously between races",
    "953": "then mary taylor whose conscience was uncomfortable said",
    "954": "but mr cresswell you surely believe in schools like miss smiths",
    "955": "mrs grey was gratified and murmured something of miss smiths sacrifice",
    "956": "positively heroic added cresswell avoiding his sisters eyes",
    "957": "mrs grey wanted particulars",
    "958": "what did you disagree about she asked bluntly",
    "959": "but you mean to say you cant even advise her",
    "960": "oh no we can",
    "961": "mrs grey wanted to hear the incident but the young man was politely reluctant",
    "962": "fortunately said mr vanderpool northerners and southerners are arriving at a better mutual understanding on most of these matters",
    "963": "yes indeed cresswell agreed",
    "964": "i thought the only excuse for fighting was a great right if right is on neither side or simultaneously on both then war is not only hell but damnation",
    "965": "mrs grey looked shocked and mrs vanderpool smiled",
    "966": "very soon after dinner charles smith excused himself",
    "967": "child",
    "968": "to her all things meant somethingnothing was aimless nothing merely happened",
    "969": "bles rushed to the edge of the swamp and stood there irresolute",
    "970": "perhapsif the water had but drained from the cottonit was so strong and tall but p shaw",
    "971": "where was the use of imagining",
    "972": "perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping",
    "973": "he started at the thought",
    "974": "he hurried forth sadly",
    "975": "the rain drops were still dripping and gleaming from the trees flashing back the heavy yellow sunlight",
    "976": "he splashed and stamped along farther and farther onward until he neared the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge",
    "977": "then he looked down",
    "978": "the lagoon was dry",
    "979": "a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green thick tall wet and willowy",
    "980": "the swamp the eternal swamp had been drained in its deepest fastness but howhow",
    "981": "he gazed about perplexed astonished",
    "982": "what a field of cotton what a marvellous field",
    "983": "he skirted the island slowly stopping near zoras oak",
    "984": "here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite work and pain some one had dug a canal from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by a long and crooked way thus allowing it to empty directly",
    "985": "there she laywet bedraggled motionless gray pallid beneath her dark drawn skin her burning eyes searching restlessly for some lost thing her lips a moaning",
    "986": "the earth staggered beneath him as he stumbled on the mud splashed and sunlight glistened he saw long snakes slithering across his path and fear struck beasts fleeing before his coming",
    "987": "miss smith he gasped and thendarkness",
    "988": "the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land",
    "989": "the cotton crop was short and poor because of the great rain but the sun had saved the best and the price had soared",
    "990": "so the world was happy and the face of the black belt green and luxuriant with thickening flecks of the coming foam of the cotton",
    "991": "up in the sick room zora lay on the little white bed",
    "992": "the net and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strove for her life with gnarled and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned",
    "993": "the silver fleece how was it",
    "994": "the sun the swamp then finding all well she closed her eyes and slept",
    "995": "after some days they let her sit by the window and she saw bles pass but drew back timidly when he looked and he saw only the flutter of her gown and waved",
    "996": "bles did not know yet that she was down but soon he would come searching for he came each hour and she pressed her little hands against her breast to still the beating of her heart and the bursting wonder of her love",
    "997": "then suddenly a panic seized her",
    "998": "the dark mystery of the swamp swept over her the place was hers",
    "999": "a great white foam was spread upon its brown and green the whole field was waving and shivering in the sunlight"
